# Calculator
This is a very beginner level python code for building calculator using functions

##Logo:
 The program begins by displaying an ASCII art logo representing a calculator, adding a visual element to the user interface.

##Arithmetic Functions:
 Four functions are defined to perform basic arithmetic operations:

 Addition (add(a, b)): Returns the sum of a and b.
 Subtraction (sub(a, b)): Returns the difference between a and b.
 Multiplication (mul(a, b)): Returns the product of a and b.
 Division (div(a, b)): Returns the quotient of a divided by b.

##Operations Dictionary:
 A dictionary operations maps arithmetic symbols to their corresponding functions, facilitating the selection of operations by users.

##The Calculator Function:
 The core functionality is encapsulated in the calculator() function, which facilitates an interactive arithmetic session:

 Input First Number: Prompts the user to input the first number.
 Display Operations: Lists available arithmetic operations for user selection.
 Operation Loop: Continues to perform calculations based on user input until the user decides to stop.
 Choose Operation: Prompts the user to select an operation.
 Input Next Number: Prompts the user to input the next number.
 Perform Calculation: Executes the selected operation and displays the result.
 Continuation Decision: Asks the user whether to continue with the current result, start a new calculation, or terminate the session.
